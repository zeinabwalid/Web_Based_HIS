# Web Based Hospital Information System (HIS)

## About:
<p> 
This is a group Project for Database course. It is required to implement web-based HIS for a hospital to facilitate the retrive of data for different queries between doctors, nurses, managers , engineers and patients.
I worked in this project on the Database of the hospital , we use MongoDB for the website and I share in the backend of the website to Form APIs to connect back-End with the database of the hospital. We use HTMl,CSS and Bootstrap for the front-End of the website.
